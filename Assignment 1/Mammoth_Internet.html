        <p class = "toppad" class = "pad"> The Internet has made massive progress since the 1990s. The amount of traffic that crosses the Internet now is 22 million times more than what was generated in 1992. Although the fiber optic <br/>
            cables replaced the century-old copper cables to transmit trillions of bits per second, the end-user at a local area is still hungry for more bandwidth to run new emerging applications. This put both <br/>
            ISPs and the mobile network operators under challenges: Are they ready for the Mammoth Internet? Will ISPs be able to offer the capacity to meet the growing demand? Is their infrastructure<br/> 
            capable of serving the future disruptive services such as 4K/8K technology, VR/AR, autonomous vehicles, etc? The literature lacks a comprehensive study of bandwidth requirements for the end- <br/>
            user in both fixed-access and mobile Internet.<br/>

        <p>The advancement of telecom technologies in recent years has opened the door for the development of next-generation digital services and applications. However, they have also led to a huge<br />
            surge in data traffic that has evolved from Kilobytes to Exabytes over the years. These data-driven services have different Internet bandwidth (BW) requirements. Therefore, the projection of the<br/>
            future BW requirements for consumers of these services is of direct interest to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and cellular networks operators. Overlooking this problem poses a real risk to their<br/>
            networks and consequently may impact their customers.<br/>

            This paper provides an insightful proiection of the future bandwidth of both fixed-access and mobile Internet. For the two approaches, fixed-access and mobile Internet, we identify the bandwidth 
            drivers and compare them in terms of their impact on the future bandwidth demand. We design our models of fixed-access/mobile Internet to cover a wide variety of household/connection-sharing 
            types and as well as users' Internet usage behavior. Our findings in fixed-access Internet show that 4K and VR/AR technology will shape the future of residential bandwidth. On the other hand,
            while IoT is growing on an everyday basis with many potential innovative technologies, it will not alter the bandwidth consumption pattern of typical households. Our model predicts a jump in 
            residential bit rate demand, especially for houses that adopt more new technology such as VR/AR and 4K video streaming. We project that more than 35% of households will demand a bit rate 
            speed of more than 100 Mbps, and 10% will require more than 300 Mbps.
